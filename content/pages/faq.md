    title: Where to buy?
  - description: To use your Dabaratus, simply click and hold the device   to dispense oil. For best results we recommend priming the device by    making sure the oil is at least room temperature as it will make the    oil flow better. You can run it under warm water to help with this in   cold weather. Once it is at room temperature, just click and hold to  dispense the oil. The Dabaratus is a one-click solution for dabbing distillate oil in a variety of different ways. The heat resistant metal tip allows you to dab directly on a nail or banger, the dispenser is also great for lining and blunt, wrapping a joint or topping a bowl. With the Dabaratus’s fully activated oil, you can use the Dabaratus almost anywhere. Check out a video on some different ways to use the Dabaratus here - [Using the Dabartus](https://vimeo.com/260434116)
    title: How to use?
  - description: Dabs are concentrated doses of cannabis oil that are made by extracting THC and other cannabinoids and terpenes (flavors & effects) from the cannabis plant. Dabs are growing in popularity with many cannabis consumers because they produce a pure, potent and flavorful cannabis experience. To consume a dab, consumers heat a hot surface, usually a nail, and then inhale using a dab rig. There are also a number of small dabbing devices that many consumers choose for their ease and portability. The act of vaporizing your concentrate on a hot surface is known as “dabbing.”
    title: What is dabbing?
  - description: With unmatched purity, potency, and taste distillate oils are quickly becoming a popular choice for cannabis consumers. Once the cannabis plant has had its oils extracted including THC and other cannabinoids and terpenes, the distillation process begins. Distillation is taking the oils from the plant and further refining them into what will become a distillate. This process increases the potency and purity of the oil, making distillates the cleanest and purest concentrates you can find.
    title: What is a distillate?
  - description: You can control how much oil comes out of the Dabaratus by adding or removing pressure on the back of the device. Although there is no precise dosing instructions for the Dabartus, it is very easy to get small amounts of oil at a time so that you are not getting too much at once.The amount of oil your Dabaratus dispenses will vary on the viscosity of the oil, how much force you add when clicking, and the temperature of the oil itself. For the best results, we recommend keeping your Dabaratus in a warm place so the oil flows easily when clicked.
